### **Code**

- [Juliia Konovalova](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova) helped me to shorten my code for better navigation experience.

- [To validate the user name with the first uppercase letter I used String.prototype.charAt()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt)

- To start a new game the resetTimer function was needed. I looked into the project code of [Alfred](https://github.com/AlfredA93), a student from my cohort in Code Institute. His mentor helped him to understand the syntax of the timer function. Alfred wrote a simple version of it, which I adopted to my code.

- Also, I watched the video tutorial from [Mr.Soderquist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoL-30L7NMRNzwiHUqSYCVQ), which assisted me in how to set the timer and to check the answer.
